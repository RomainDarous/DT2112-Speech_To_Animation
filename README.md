# Speech To Animation project
Berkan Yapici, Romain Darous.

## Abstract
"The present study investigated automated modeling of 3D Avatar faces using only audio input. Various applications can be envisioned for 3D model animations (cinema, animated movies, video games, virtual reality...) at a lower cost compared to motion capture. In this study, we trained the SAiD model [4] to perform speechdriven face animation on Unreal Engine MetaHumans. While our results did not match the performance of the SAiD model, we were still able to generate usable animations that exhibited some relevant articulation patterns."
